## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 5-phase structure derived from requirement categories (CONN, BOARD, DND, UX) with infrastructure Phase 2 for Rust API client
- [Roadmap]: Phase 2 (Data Pipeline) has no direct v1 requirements but is critical infrastructure -- all board/DnD phases depend on it

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- API key secure storage: tauri-plugin-keyring compatibility with Tauri 2 is unconfirmed. Fallback is encrypted plugin-store. Decision needed in Phase 1.
- Backlog free-plan rate limits: Exact thresholds not published. Must query at runtime. May impact Phase 2 loading strategy.
